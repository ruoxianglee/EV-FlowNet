Loss（所有的loss加到一起 -> total loss）
(1)photometric loss:
    the flow is used to warp the second image to the first image using bilinear sampling
    the photometric loss aims to minimize the difference in intensity between the warped second image and the first image

(2)smoothness loss:
    Works as a regularizer term to avoid the aperture problem.
    aims to regularize the output flow by minimizing the difference in flow between neighbouring pixels horizontally,
        vertically and diagonally.

(3)weight decay loss


Event Image如何构建的啊？
